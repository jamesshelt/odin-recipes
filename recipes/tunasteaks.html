    Ahi Tuna Steaks

    These Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks (also known as yellowfin or bigeye tuna) take only SIX MINUTES to cook to medium-rare perfection and are bursting with delicious umami flavor from the soy sauce and toasted sesame honey marinade recipe! And since marinating is optional, you can whip this tuna steak recipe up at a moment’s notice. I like serving these seared tuna steaks with rice and green beans, or simply over a bed of greens with an Asian-style salad dressing.

<h4>
    Ingredients:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna) steaks (about 4 oz. each, 1" thick – see notes for thinner or thicker)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 Eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil see notes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey see notes</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil or olive oil</li>
    <li>green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges for serving (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Steps: 
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.</li>
    <li>Mix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it.</li>
    <li>Heat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high until very hot ( or medium medium-high for nonstick). I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes to get hot and nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is.</li>
    <li>Add the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 1 – 1½ minutes on each side for medium rare ( 2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for very rare. See notes – this will vary based on thickness of the tuna steaks). (Note: different burners get hotter depending on your stove. Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may burn if too high heat is used)</li>
    <li>Remove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.</li>
