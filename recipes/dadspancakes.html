<h4>
    Ingredients:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2-2 C Rolled Oats (organic recommended)</li>
    <li>2 C Whole Milk</li>
    <li>2 Eggs</li>
    <li>2 Tbs Sugar</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp Baking Powder (NOT soda :) )</li>
    <li>2 Tbs oil (olive, veg, etc)</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp Salt</li>
    <li>3/4 C All Purpose Flour (adds fluffiness)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Steps: 
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a skillet or pan to medium-low to medium heat. It is better to have the heat too low to begin with.</li>
    <li>Lightly blend all ingredients except Flour.
        Oats should be partially ground, but not blended smooth.</li>
    <li>Add Flour and mix 5-10 seconds, avoiding over-blending.</li>
    <li>Consistency should be closer to milk than batter. It will appear too runny. 
        If thick, add 1/8 C milk at a time until mixture is runny. Pancakes rise and thicken as they cook.</li>
    <li>Add first group of pancakes to lightly greased pan. (Note: the oil in the mix will be sufficient after first group of pancakes are cooked.)</li>
    <li>Add chocolate chips, or other tastiness as desired.</li>
    <li>Cook until bubbles are present and bottom is firm. Then flip.</li>
    <li>Enjoy Dad's Pancakes! We love these. :) </li>
</ol>
